# System-Design-Portfollio

# Briefly summerize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements, Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
Artemis Finacial is a consulting company that provides financial plans to its customers. The client has issues with system security and would like to implement a security feature to prevent vulnerabilities and protect customer information. As a software engineer, I am addressing their RESTFul web application from attacks and external threats.

# What did you do very well when you found your client's software security vulnerabilities? why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company's overall well-being?
I was able to generate a dependency vulnerability document to review what dependencies are vulnerable to attacks. Coding securely helps to keep the system secure prevent external threats and mitigate the risk of a data breach.

# What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
Generating a certificate was simple but implementing the certificate to generate the Checksum was challenging. 

# How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities? 
I ran the application multiple times for the changes I implemented and ran a test to make sure my code was correct. after I tested my code, I ran a dependency check again and compared it with the first dependency check ( before refactoring) and I verified that I did not introduce any new vulnerabilities.

# What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
OWASP top 10, Course resources, and java practice.

# Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show your future employers from this assignment?
This assignment showcases my ability to produce an effective and clean code while maintaining system security.
